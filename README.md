============

Fun stuff with orienteering meet result files from SI Simple

6/24/14 - Things to do:

1. Implement code to use only the 10 best races - needed in three weeks
2. Send results directly to google drive spreadsheet - needed, whenever

7/31/14

Code to collect and sum each runner's ten best races is done. 
Other stuff to do:

1. Separate men's/women's results, maybe by looking up women's names 
   from a list? - do by next week
2. Still hoping to get g-drive upload done this year, and improve the
   output format so you don't have to adjust it in the spreadsheet
   program every time
